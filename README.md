# FASTAI LIVE VIDEO LOGO OBFUSCATION
The Project aims To DETECT and OBFUSCATE specific brand logos from clothing in a live video feed. 

## Problem Statement
A lot of movies, TV shows, or music videos blur out, remove or cover out the logos and/or brand names of certain companies when they appear on screen. This is known as product displacement. 

Whenever they are including the product or service of a particular brand in their creative work, they are in one way advertising the product of that brand amongst its viewers.  Many producers often expect the brands to pay for such advertisement. But, when the brands refuse to sponsor or pay for such inclusion, the producers often blur out or remove the logo of the brand from its products. 

While it is certainly not illegal to use trademarked products in the visual media by films, TV shows, and music videos, they often resort to product displacement, for a number of reasons, ranging from ‘avoiding the legal battles’ to ‘not wanting to annoy a sponsor’.
